## **1. Database Normalization**  <a name="database-normalization"></a>
Normalization is the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and improve integrity.

### **Goals of Normalization**  
- Eliminate duplicate data.  
- Ensure logical data storage.  
- Enhance data integrity.  

### **Normal Forms**  
Normalization involves applying a series of rules called *normal forms (NF)*:  

#### **1NF (First Normal Form)**  
- Ensure that each column contains atomic values.  
- Example:

**Original Table:**  
| CustomerID | PhoneNumbers    |  
|------------|-----------------|  
| 1          | 12345, 67890    |  

**Normalized Table:**  
| CustomerID | PhoneNumber     |  
|------------|-----------------|  
| 1          | 12345           |  
| 1          | 67890           |  

#### **2NF (Second Normal Form)**   
- Data must be in 1NF and all non-key attributes must depend on the primary key.   

#### **3NF (Third Normal Form)**   
- Data must be in 2NF and all attributes must only depend on the primary key (no transitive dependency).  

#### **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**   
- Stronger version of 3NF. Every determinant must be a candidate key.

## **2. Transactions and ACID Properties**  <a name="transactions-and-acid-properties"></a>

### **Understanding Transactions**   
A transaction is a sequence of database operations performed as a single logical unit.   

### **ACID Properties**   
1. **Atomicity**: All operations are completed, or none are.   
2. **Consistency**: Maintains database integrity.   
3. **Isolation**: Transactions do not interfere with each other.   
4. **Durability**: Committed changes are permanent.   

### **Examples of Transactions**  
#### Transfer Money Between Accounts:  

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

#### Rollback in Case of Error:

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 10 WHERE product_id = 101;
-- Simulate an error
ROLLBACK;
```

## **3. Indexing in Databases** <a name="indexing-in-databases"></a>

### **Types of Indexes**  

- **Single-Column Index:** For a single column.  
- **Composite Index:** For multiple columns.  
- **Unique Index:** Ensures unique values in a column.  
- **Full-Text Index:** For text searches.  


### **When to Use Indexes**

- Use for columns frequently queried in WHERE, ORDER BY, or GROUP BY clauses.  
- Avoid indexing columns with high update frequency.  
- Analyzing Query Performance  
- Use the EXPLAIN keyword to analyze query execution plans:  

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

## **4. Performance Tuning** <a name="performance-tuning"></a>

### **Optimizing Queries**  

1. Use SELECT only required columns:  

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees;  -- Instead of SELECT *  
```

2. Avoid Complex Joins: Simplify where possible.  
3. Index Key Columns:  

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON employees(salary);
```

**Database Partitioning**  
Partitioning divides a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces.  
 
- **Horizontal Partitioning:** Divides rows.    
- **Vertical Partitioning:** Divides columns.    


**Best Practices**  
- Regularly update statistics for query optimizers.    
- Archive old data to reduce table size.    
- Avoid using functions on indexed columns in queries.

##  **5. Practice Tasks** <a name="practice-tasks"></a>

1. Normalize a sample dataset to 3NF.  
2. Write a transaction for transferring funds between accounts, ensuring rollback on failure.    
3. Create an index on a frequently queried column and analyze its performance.    
4. Partition a large dataset and demonstrate its query benefits.
