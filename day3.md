### Day 3: Control Flow â€“ Making Decisions in Python <a name="Control-Flow"></a>
Welcome to Day 3!  
Now that we know about variables and data types, letâ€™s learn how to make programs smarter by controlling their flow. With control flow, we can make decisions, repeat actions, and manage the behavior of our code.

### Why Control Flow? <a name="Why-Control-Flow"></a>
Control flow allows your program to respond to different situations. For example:

- If itâ€™s raining, take an umbrella.
- If a number is even, print it; otherwise, skip it.

In Python, we achieve this using **if-else statements** and **loops.**

### 1. If-Else Statements <a name="If-Else"></a>  
An **if-else statement** allows your program to execute code based on a condition.

**Syntax:**  
``` python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is False
```

**Example:**  
```python
temperature = 30

if temperature > 25:
    print("It's hot outside!")
else:
    print("It's cool today.")
```

ðŸ’¡ Conditions are expressions that evaluate to True or False. Common operators include:

- **>: Greater than**
- **<: Less than**
- **==: Equals**
- **!=: Not equals**

### 2. Elif (Else If)  <a name="Else-If"></a>  
When you have multiple conditions, use **elif.**

**Example:**  
```python
marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
else:
    print("Grade: C")
```

### 3. Logical Operators  <a name="Logical-Operators"></a>  
Combine multiple conditions using:  

- **and: Both conditions must be True.**
- **or: At least one condition must be True.**
- **not: Reverses the condition.**

**Example:**  
```python
age = 20
has_id = True

if age >= 18 and has_id:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("You cannot vote.")
```

### 4. Loops â€“ Repeating Actions <a name="Loops"></a>  
Loops allow you to repeat code multiple times. Python has two main loops:

### A. For Loop <a name="For-Loop"></a>  
Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or range).

**Example:**  
```python
for number in range(1, 6):
    print(number)
```

Here, range(1, 6) generates numbers from 1 to 5.

ðŸ’¡ You can also loop through strings:
```python
for char in "Python":
    print(char)
```

### B. While Loop <a name="While-Loop"></a>  
Repeats as long as a condition is True.

**Example:**
```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```

### 5. Break and Continue  <a name="Break-and-Continue"></a>  
- **break:** Stops the loop entirely.
- **continue:** Skips the rest of the loop and moves to the next iteration.  
**Example â€“ Break:**  
```python
for number in range(1, 10):
    if number == 5:
        break
    print(number)
```

**Example â€“ Continue:**  
```python
for number in range(1, 10):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(number)  # Prints only odd numbers
```

**Quick Practice**  <a name="practice"></a>   
1. Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.  
2. Use a loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 20.  
3. Write a guessing game: the user has to guess a number, and the program gives hints until they guess it correctly.  

**Wrap-Up**  <a name="Wrap-Up"></a>  
Today, you learned:  

- How to make decisions in Python using if-else and elif.  
- How to repeat actions using for and while loops.  
- How to control loops with break and continue.  
- Practice these concepts and try to solve real-world problems, like creating a calculator or a number guessing game. Tomorrow, weâ€™ll dive into functions, which will make your programs even more modular and reusable!

**Keep coding, and happy learning! ðŸš€**
