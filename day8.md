# Day 8: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python – Organizing Code for Better Reusability and Structure  

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can hold data (attributes) and methods (functions). It helps organize code, making it reusable, maintainable, and efficient.  

Let’s explore OOP concepts in Python in detail with examples and real-time use cases!

## Why Use OOP?  <a name="why-OOP"></a>  
1. **Reusability**: Code can be reused across projects.  
2. **Modularity**: Break complex problems into smaller parts.  
3. **Maintainability**: Changes can be made to individual parts without affecting others.  
4. **Scalability**: Suitable for larger projects as it keeps the code organized.

## Key OOP Concepts  <a name="key"></a>
### 1. **Class and Object**  
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.  
- **Object**: An instance of a class.  

### Syntax  
```python  
class ClassName:  
    # attributes and methods  
    pass  

# Create an object  
obj = ClassName()  
```  

### Example: Defining and Using a Class  
```python  
class Car:  
    def __init__(self, brand, model):  # Constructor  
        self.brand = brand  
        self.model = model  

    def display_info(self):  # Method  
        print(f"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}")  

# Create objects  
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")  
car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic")  

# Call methods  
car1.display_info()  
car2.display_info()  
```  

---

### 2. **Attributes and Methods**  <a name="Attributes-and-Methods"></a>  
- **Attributes**: Variables that hold data about the object.  
- **Methods**: Functions defined in a class that can manipulate object attributes.  

### Example  
```python  
class Rectangle:  
    def __init__(self, length, width):  
        self.length = length  
        self.width = width  

    def area(self):  
        return self.length * self.width  

# Create object  
rect = Rectangle(5, 3)  
print("Area:", rect.area())  # Output: Area: 15  
```  

---

### 3. **Encapsulation**  <a name="Encapsulation"></a>  
- Bundling data and methods together.  
- Use `_` or `__` to make attributes private.  

### Example  
```python  
class BankAccount:  
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):  
        self.__account_number = account_number  # Private attribute  
        self.__balance = balance  

    def deposit(self, amount):  
        self.__balance += amount  

    def get_balance(self):  
        return self.__balance  

# Create object  
account = BankAccount("12345", 1000)  
account.deposit(500)  
print("Balance:", account.get_balance())  # Output: Balance: 1500  
```  

---

### 4. **Inheritance**  <a name="Inheritance"></a>  
- One class can inherit properties and methods from another.  

### Example  
```python  
class Animal:  
    def sound(self):  
        print("This animal makes a sound.")  

class Dog(Animal):  
    def sound(self):  
        print("Bark!")  

# Create object  
dog = Dog()  
dog.sound()  # Output: Bark!  
```  

---

### 5. **Polymorphism**  <a name="Polymorphism"></a>  
- Different classes can have methods with the same name, allowing for flexibility.  

### Example  
```python  
class Bird:  
    def fly(self):  
        print("Birds can fly.")  

class Penguin(Bird):  
    def fly(self):  
        print("Penguins cannot fly.")  

# Create objects  
sparrow = Bird()  
penguin = Penguin()  

sparrow.fly()  # Output: Birds can fly.  
penguin.fly()  # Output: Penguins cannot fly.  
```  

---

### 6. **Abstraction**  <a name="Abstraction"></a>  
- Hiding implementation details and showing only the necessary parts.  
- Achieved using abstract base classes.  

### Example  
```python  
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod  

class Shape(ABC):  
    @abstractmethod  
    def area(self):  
        pass  

class Circle(Shape):  
    def __init__(self, radius):  
        self.radius = radius  

    def area(self):  
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2  

# Create object  
circle = Circle(5)  
print("Area:", circle.area())  # Output: Area: 78.5  
```  

---

## Real-Time Use Cases  <a name="use-case"></a>  

1. **Game Development**:  
   - Define classes for `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Weapon`.  
   - Example: A `Player` class with attributes like health and methods like attack().  

2. **Banking Systems**:  
   - Classes for `Account`, `Transaction`, and `Customer`.  
   - Encapsulation ensures secure handling of sensitive data.  

3. **E-commerce Platforms**:  
   - Classes for `Product`, `Customer`, and `Order`.  
   - Reusability and modularity simplify development.  

4. **Web Applications**:  
   - Use OOP in backend frameworks like Django, where models are defined as classes.  

---

### Quick Practice <a name="Practice"></a>   
1. Create a `Library` class with attributes like `books` and methods like `add_book` and `lend_book`.  
2. Create objects for the class and demonstrate its functionality.  

---
### Wrap-Up <a name="Wrap-Up"></a>  
Today, we dove deep into the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Here’s a quick recap of what we covered:  

**Classes and Objects:**    

- A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have.  
- An object is an instance of a class. It contains real data and is created using the class.  

**Core Concepts of OOP:**

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit called a class. This keeps data safe from outside interference and misuse.  
- **Inheritance:** The ability for a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, allowing for code reuse.  
- **Polymorphism:** The ability for different classes to use the same method names but perform different actions, depending on the object calling it.  
- **Abstraction:** Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.  

**Benefits of OOP:**  

- **Reusability:** You can reuse classes and methods in different parts of your program or in different programs altogether.  
- **Maintainability:** Code is easier to maintain since it's organized into small, manageable sections (classes and objects).  
- **Scalability:** OOP makes it easier to add new features or modify existing ones without disrupting the rest of the system.  

OOP is a powerful tool for organizing code. By understanding its principles, you can write cleaner, more maintainable, and reusable code!    

Don't forget to practice creating your own classes and objects with real-world examples to get comfortable with the concepts we covered today!

**See you on Day 9!**
