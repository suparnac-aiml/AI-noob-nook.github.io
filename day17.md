## **1. Advanced Filtering with Subqueries**   <a name="Advanced-Filtering-with-Subqueries"></a>
Subqueries (or nested queries) allow you to write queries inside other queries, making it possible to handle complex filtering and comparisons.  

### **Key Concepts**
- **Subquery in `WHERE` Clause**: Filters data based on conditions defined in another query.
- **Subquery in `FROM` Clause**: Acts as a temporary table.
- **Subquery in `SELECT` Clause**: Calculates derived values.

### **Example**  
Retrieve employees earning more than the average salary of their department:  

```sql
SELECT name, salary, department
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department
    HAVING department = employees.department
);
```

---

## **2. Joins: Combining Tables**  <a name="Joins-Combining-Tables"></a>
Joins allow combining rows from two or more tables based on related columns.

### **Types of Joins**
- **Inner Join:** Returns rows with matching values in both tables.  
- **Left Join:** Returns all rows from the left table, with matching rows from the right table.  
- **Right Join:** Returns all rows from the right table, with matching rows from the left table.  
- **Full Outer Join:** Returns all rows with matches from either table.  
- **Self Join:** Joins a table with itself.

### **Example**
List employees and their managers:
```sql
SELECT e.name AS Employee, m.name AS Manager
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN employees m
ON e.manager_id = m.id;
```

---

## **3. Set Operations  <a name="Set-Operations"></a>
Combine results of two or more queries using set operations.

**Types of Set Operations**
- **UNION:** Combines results, removing duplicates.  
- **UNION ALL:** Combines all results, including duplicates.  
- **INTERSECT:** Returns only common rows.  
- **EXCEPT (or MINUS):** Returns rows in the first query but not in the second.  

### **Example**
Combine employees from IT and HR departments:  

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT'
UNION
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';

```

---

## 4. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  <a name="Common-Table-Expressions"></a>
CTEs simplify complex queries by allowing you to define temporary result sets.

**Syntax**

```sql
WITH CTE_name AS (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT * FROM CTE_name;

```

### **Example**
Find top earners in each department:

```sql
WITH DepartmentSalaries AS (
    SELECT department, name, salary,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
    FROM employees
)
SELECT * FROM DepartmentSalaries WHERE rank = 1;
```

---

## **5. Working with Built-in Functions**  <a name="Working-with-Built-in-Functions"></a>
Leverage SQL's powerful built-in functions for data manipulation and aggregation.  

**String Functions**  
- **CONCAT(), SUBSTRING(), UPPER(), LOWER().**    
- **Example**  
-  ```sql
   SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;  
   ```

**Date Functions**  
- **CURRENT_DATE, DATEADD(), DATEDIFF().**  
- **Example:**  
-  ```sql
   SELECT name, DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, hire_date) AS days_worked FROM employees;
   ```

**Aggregate Functions**  
- **SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN().**  
- **Example:**  
- ```sql
     SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department;  
   ```

---


## **6. Window Functions**  <a name="Window-Functions"></a>
Analyze data across rows without collapsing them into aggregates.  

**Key Functions**
- **ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LEAD(), LAG().**  
- **Example**  
  Rank employees by salary within each department

  ```sql
  SELECT name, department, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
  FROM employees;
  ```

---

## **7. Transactions and Data Integrity**  <a name="Transactions-and-Data-Integrity"></a>
Transactions ensure a sequence of SQL operations are executed as a single unit, maintaining data consistency.

**ACID Properties**  
- **Atomicity:** All or nothing.  
- **Consistency:** Keeps the database in a valid state.  
- **Isolation:** Transactions donâ€™t interfere.  
- **Durability:** Changes are permanent.  
- **Example**  
  Transfer funds between accounts:
  
  ```sql
  BEGIN;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE account_id = 1;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE account_id = 2;
  COMMIT;
  ```

---

## **8. Indexing for Performance Optimization**  <a name="Indexing-for-Performance-Optimization"></a>
Indexes improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval.  

**Creating Indexes**  

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON employees(salary);
```

**Using ```sql EXPLAIN ``` for Query Analysis**  
Analyze query execution plans to identify bottlenecks.

---

## **Tasks for Practice** <a name="Practice"></a>
Write a query using subqueries and joins to find employees earning above the department average.
Use set operations to combine data from multiple tables.
Create a CTE to calculate cumulative sales by month.
Analyze query performance before and after adding an index.
